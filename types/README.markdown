Inline Object Type Examples
===========================

The classes in this directly aren't strictly part of the library and are
here only to serve as example of the types of inline objects that can
be created.

An example file, `example.php` shows how each type can be used and can be
executed to see the types in action.

The types aren't meant to be used as-is. Some of these types might be a bit
worthless or even open up potential security holes of the `exec()` nature
(see the `Function` type).

So, use these as examples and starting points, and have fun.
